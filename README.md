# kaggle-CIFAR-10

This repo workes on the Kaggle competition [CIFAR-10 - Object Recognition in Images](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cifar-10).

## Methods
Deep learning models are main focus in this competition.

### Deep learning
- SimpleCNN: a self-designed simple CNN model, with 8 layers
- miniResNet: a smaller version of ResNet, with 22 layers
- ResNet50_freeze: pretrained ResNet50, with all weights freezed
- ResNet50_finetune: pretrained ResNet50
(all data are centered for deep learning)

#### To-do list
